# This is a clean Laravel 8 install with a Bootstrap template.

The fastest and easiest way to start is by running the bat-file like this: "{Path-to-project}>setup.bat"

I do assume that you already have php, nodejs and git installed and also a server like Laragon. You also need to duplicate the .env.example file, rename it to .env and change the DB_DATABASE name if needed. After this you can run the bat file.
